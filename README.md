# password-generator

In my latest development, I have created an application that an employee or anyone for that matter to use and generate a random password based on criteria they have selected to provide greater security. This app runs in the browser, and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that I wrote. It has a clean and polished user interface that is responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.
